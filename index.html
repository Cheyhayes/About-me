                <h2>My Sports</h2>
                <h3> Skiing</h3>
                    <p>I ski race for Rowmark ski team. This is my first year because I have alwayes raced at P.C.M.R. I started skiing when I was two
                            but didn't start racing until I was 6. My favorite ski mountains are P.C.M.R. and Sun Vally, however, as far
                            as powder skiing goes I love Snowbird! I hate Deer Vally and The Canyons. I have skiied all over the world including Germany, Switzerland, and France.
                            </p>
                <h3> Horse back riding</h3>
                    <p>I have been riding almost as long as I've been skiing! I started out riding english-style when I was three. I had started jumping
                            and a little bit of dressage. When I was 7 I got my first horse named Montana King. Becouse he was brown and white we called him doubles (which
                            some how got shortend to Dubs). He was a western horse so I switched my riding styles. Not long after, I got another horse named Commit. She had a foal (baby horse)
                            That we named Tempest. After the foal was deliverd we sold both of them and got a barrel racing horse named Maverick. I still have
                            Mavrick and Dubs today and I still barrel race.</p>
                <h3> Karate</h3>
                    <p> Karate is a sport I only do one time a week. It keeps me in shape for my other to sports and helps me learn to defend myself.
                            I am a high green belt right now, training with Peak Karate stud
